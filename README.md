### Academic Personal Website
This repository contains a static, responsive and modern personal website template for an academic. 
The site is designed to be deployed easily to any static web host (e.g. GitHub Pages, Netlify or a university server) and provides a clean, mobileâ€‘friendly way to present information about a researcher or lecturer.

## Features
Singleâ€‘page layout â€“ All sections (Home, About, Publications, Research Areas, Education and Contact) live on one page with smooth scrolling navigation.

Responsive design â€“ The layout adapts gracefully to desktop, tablet and mobile devices. A collapsible hamburger menu appears on smaller screens.

Clean colour palette â€“ Uses a white, blue and grey colour scheme with subtle accents to maintain an elegant, professional appearance.

Custom imagery â€“ AIâ€‘themed background and illustration images are included in the images/ folder. These were generated specifically for the template so you can use them freely or replace them with your own.

Animation effects â€“ Sections slide smoothly into view as the user scrolls, thanks to the use of the IntersectionObserver API and CSS transitions.

Easy customisation â€“ All of the content areas contain placeholder text. You can replace them with your own biography, publication list, research fields, education history and contact details by editing index.html.

index.html
The HTML document defines the overall structure of the site. It includes a fixed navigation bar with anchor links to each section and uses semantic section tags (<section id="about">, etc.) for clarity. Each content area contains placeholder text in Turkish that you should replace with your own information.

style.css
The stylesheet sets up a CSS custom propertyâ€“driven colour palette and uses flexbox to align elements. Media queries ensure that the layout remains usable on smaller devices. A few basic animations are defined with the @keyframes rule to fade content into view. You can adjust colours and spacing by modifying the root variables at the top of this file.

script.js
The JavaScript file adds two pieces of interactivity:

Mobile navigation â€“ When the screen width is below 768px, the navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu. Clicking the menu icon toggles the visibility of the navigation links.

Scroll reveal â€“ As you scroll down the page, sections that are about to enter the viewport receive a .show class, triggering a fadeâ€‘in animation. This is implemented using the IntersectionObserver API for efficiency.

Getting started
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Kopyala
DÃ¼zenle
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>/website
Open index.html in your browser to see the site. No build tools are required.

Customise the content by editing the placeholder text in index.html. Replace the dummy biography, publications, research areas, education entries and contact information with your own details.

Change the images (optional). If youâ€™d like to use different photos or illustrations, place your files in the images/ directory and update the <img> tags and CSS background-image declarations accordingly.

Deploy. Once you are happy with the site, push the files to a GitHub repository. If you are using GitHub Pages, ensure that the root of your pages site contains index.html, style.css, script.js and the images/ folder. GitHub Pages will automatically serve the site.

ðŸš§ Future improvements
This template is intended as a starting point. Possible enhancements include:

Adding a JSON file to drive the content dynamically or pulling your publication list from an external source (e.g. Google Scholar or ORCID via an API).

Including a blog section or news feed to post updates about your research.

Integrating contact form handling via a serverless service (such as Netlify Forms) if you need actual message delivery.
